### Single Line Comments
You can add comments to your code in several ways.
Single line comments start with a # and go until the end of the line

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello World")  # This is also a comment
```
### Multi Line Comments
If you want to extend a comment for multiple lines, you can use triple quotes (single or double)

```python
''' This is a comment that
    extends until the next triple
    quote is encountered
''' 
print("Hello World")
"""" 
  You can also use double quotes to create a multi-line
  comment block 
"""   
```

## Variables

In Python, a ***variable*** is the name of a computer memory location that can store a certain value.

In manner of speaking, we say things like :

- "A variable stores/holds a value or object"
- "A value is assigned to a variable"
- "The (value of a) variable may change or can remain constant"

In Python, every variable is an object and there is no need to declare the variable before their use.

### Numbers

Python supports 3 **types** of numbers (int, float and complex).

```python
i = 5       # integer arbitrary length 
f = 2.37    # floating point number (typically 64 bit)
j = 2+3j    # complex number (typically 2 x 64 bit)
```
_Note prior to Python 3.6, Python had two integer types int (32-bit) and long (arbitrary). Now all integers
have arbitrary length_

### Boolean

Python also supports the notion of boolean values (which are really a subtype of int).

```python
t_val = True     
f_val = False    
```

### Strings

In python strings are defined using either single or double quotes. The opening and closing quote must match. They must
either both start and end with a single quote, or both start and end with a double quote.

```python
string1 = 'hello there'       
string2 = "I am also a string"
string3 = "I'm also a string"   # No need to escape the single quote, because string is defined with double quotes
string4 = 'I\'m also a string'  # Here a single quote appearing inside a single quoted string needs to be escaped
```



### Dynamic Type

Often, you may hear people say, *"Python is a dynamically-typed language"*. This means that the same variable can hold different types of objects during the course of execution of a program. In the example below, observe how the same variable holds different types of objects !

``` python
temp = 30		# integer
print(type(temp))	# type (variablename) is a special built-in function

temp = 133.3	# float
print(type(temp))

temp = "Very hot !"	# string
print(type(temp))
```



### Printing

Python allows variables to be passed to print statements using commas to separate items 

```python
i = 5       # integer
f = 2.37    # floating point number
j = 2+3j    # complex number

# print("The value of i = ", i)
print("The value of f = ", f)
print("The value of j = ", j)
print("The value of i = ", i, ", f=", f)

print("The sum of 1 + f + j ", i + f + j)  # The numbers are added together and then printed out
```

Strings may be concatenated together using the + operator
```python
string1 = 'Hello'       
string2 = "World"
print(string1 + " " + string2)

print("The length of string1 is ", len(string1))
```

### Exercise

Modify your Hello World program to greet you by name, where your name is stored in a variable.

Also, add some variables with different types and print them (as shown in the printing section above).
