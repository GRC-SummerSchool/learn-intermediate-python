# Hello World

The Pycharm IDE provides the development environment to create, edit, run and debug your
python programs.

## Creating a first project

Our first program will be the traditional "Hello World" program. This program is traditionally
first program used to introduce language, syntax and environment to people learning to program. Select File->New Project to create a new project.

### Creating a new python file

To create your hello-world.py file, right click on your project to bring up the menu. 
Select New->Python File.

You will then be prompted for a file name. Enter hello-world.py:

![](.HelloWorld_images/new_file.png)

You will now see a blank editor window (hello-world.py). This is where we type our first 
program. Notice the project tree on the left shows that hello-world.py is part of your project.

### Edit your program

Type in your first program. Here we will use the built-in *print* function to output a string to the console.

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Right click on your file in the project tree, and select "Run"

Notice in the bottom pane of your IDE, you see the console showing your programs output.
